    <h4>TIPS FROM COPILOT</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Semantic HTML: </strong>Use semantic tags like "article", "section", "nav", and "aside" to improve SEO and accessibility. This also makes your code more readable and maintainable.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Attributes: </strong>Utilize custom "data-*" attributes for storing extra information that doesn't have any visual representation but can be used by scripts.</li>
      <li><strong>Accessible Forms: </strong>Ensure your forms are accessible by using proper labels, fieldsets, and legends. Also, consider adding ARIA roles where necessary.</li>
      <li><strong>Lazy Loading: </strong>Implement lazy loading for images and iframes with the `loading="lazy"` attribute to improve page load times.</li>
      <li><strong>Template Tags: </strong>Use the "template" tag to hold content that you can instantiate and render on the page via JavaScript.</li>
      <li><strong>Microdata: </strong>Add microdata to your HTML to help search engines understand the content and context of your pages better.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid Inline Styles: </strong>Keep your presentation separate from your content by avoiding inline styles. This promotes a cleaner separation of concerns.</li>
      <li><strong>Use of Figure and Figcaption: </strong>For images with captions, use the "figure" and "figcaption" elements to associate the text directly with the image.</li>
      <li><strong>Minimize Divs: </strong>Don't overuse "div" elements. Instead, try to use more descriptive HTML5 elements to structure your content.</li>
      <li><strong>HTML Validation: </strong>Regularly run your HTML through a validator to catch errors and ensure that your markup is up to standard.</li>
    </ol>
