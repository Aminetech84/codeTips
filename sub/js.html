    <h4>TIPS FROM COPILOT</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Understand the Basics: </strong>Before jumping into frameworks, make sure you have a solid understanding of vanilla JavaScript. This will make it easier to debug and understand what frameworks are doing under the hood.</li>
      <li><strong>Modular Code: </strong>Write modular and reusable code. Break your code into smaller functions that do one thing and do it well. This makes your code more testable and maintainable.</li>
      <li><strong>DOM Manipulation: </strong>Be efficient with your Document Object Model (DOM) manipulations. Minimize direct DOM manipulation, use efficient selectors, and batch your changes to avoid reflow and repaint performance issues.</li>
      <li><strong>Embrace ES6 Features: </strong>Use ES6 features like arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, and the spread operator to write cleaner and more concise code.</li>
      <li><strong>Asynchronous Programming: </strong>Get comfortable with asynchronous programming using promises and async/await. This will help you handle operations that take time, like fetching data from an API.</li>
      <li><strong>Debugging Skills: </strong>Familiarize yourself with browser developer tools for debugging. Knowing how to effectively use breakpoints, step through code, and inspect variables will save you a lot of time.</li>
      <li><strong>Version Control: </strong>Learn and use version control with Git. It's essential for managing your codebase, collaborating with others, and deploying your applications.</li>
      <li><strong>Code Comments: </strong>Comment your code, but do it wisely. Good comments explain why something is done, not what is being done. The code itself should be self-explanatory.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid Global Variables: </strong>Minimize the use of global variables to avoid conflicts and maintain a clean global namespace.</li>
      <li><strong>Testing: </strong>Write tests for your code. Whether it's unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests, testing helps ensure your code works as expected and can prevent future bugs.</li>
    </ol>
