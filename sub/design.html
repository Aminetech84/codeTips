    <h4>TYPOGRAPHY</h4>
    <pre>
      <h3> ## Typography and Spacing </h3>
  - Establish a consistent scale for fonts, for example:
    - `p` should be larger than 1em, `h3` larger than 2em, `h2` larger than 3em, `h1` larger than 4em.
  - Apply a similar approach to spacing, using a scale that creates visual harmony.
  - Keep paragraphs short for better readability, aiming for 50-60 characters per line.
  - Use **SERIF** fonts for headings to convey elegance and tradition.
  - Opt for **sans-serif** fonts for body text for a clean and modern look.
  - Limit font families to one or two that complement each other well.
  - Utilize font weight to create a visual hierarchy and draw attention to key areas, font weight is your friend.
          
      <h3> ## Color Theory </h3>       
  - Understand the primary colors: blue, red, and yellow, and their psychological impact.
  - Saturation affects a color's vividness(vivid or boring); use it to create mood and focus.
  - Colors convey emotions: 
    - red for passion,  exiting, energetic
    - blue for trust, intelligence, security
    - orange for friendliness, calm vibe or happiness
    - green for peace, health, nature
    - black for power, classiness
    - white for innocence.
  - A monochromatic color scheme (white and black) can create a clean and elegant website.
  - Use one main color and adjust saturation and lightness for variety (darker for headers and lighter for shapes and text).
  - Explore color schemes with tools like Adobe Color, considering analogous, monochromatic, triad, or complementary palettes (use primary and secondary color).

      <h3> ## Building a Color Scheme </h3>
  - First work on the website in just black and white
  - Introduce one main color to establish the brand identity.
  - Add a secondary color only if necessary to support the primary color.
  - work with complimentary colors
  - add variation with shades
  - bring in a complimentary color
  - Use shades and tints to add depth and dimension.
  - Incorporate a complementary color to create visual interest and balance.
