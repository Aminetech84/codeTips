  <h4>TYPOGRAPHY</h4>
  <pre>
      ## Typography and Spacing
      
      - Establish a consistent scale for fonts, for example:
        - `p` should be larger than 1em, `h3` larger than 2em, `h2` larger than 3em, `h1` larger than 4em.
      - Apply a similar approach to spacing, using a scale that creates visual harmony.
      - Keep paragraphs short for better readability, aiming for 50-60 characters per line.
      - Use **SERIF** fonts for headings to convey elegance and tradition.
      - Opt for **sans-serif** fonts for body text for a clean and modern look.
      - Limit font families to one or two that complement each other well.
      - Utilize font weight to create a visual hierarchy and draw attention to key areas.

          - get a consistent scale for fonts, ex:
            - p > 16px, h3 > 32px, h2 > 48px, h1 > 64px.
          - do the same with spacing
          - Don't make very long paragraphs
          - use SERIF or similar fonts for heading
          - use sans serif for normal text
          - Serif gives classic elegant look
          - use only one font, two at most that compliment each other
          - font weight is your friend
          


          ## Color Theory
          
          - Understand the primary colors: blue, red, and yellow, and their psychological impact.
          - Saturation affects a color's vividness; use it to create mood and focus.
          - Colors convey emotions: red for passion, blue for trust, orange for friendliness, green for peace, black for power, and white for innocence.
          - A monochromatic color scheme can create a clean and elegant website.
          - Use one main color and adjust saturation and lightness for variety.
          - Explore color schemes with tools like Adobe Color, considering analogous, monochromatic, triad, or complementary palettes.
          
          - Primary Colors: blue, red and yellow
          - Saturation make colors vivid or boring
          - red represent passion, exiting energetic
          - blue represent intelligence, security, trust
          - orange gives friendly, calm vibe or happiness
          - green , health, nature , peace
          - black represent classiness and power
          - white represent innocent
          - going just white and black can give a very clean website
          - choose only one color for the website and use saturation and lightness
            - darker for headers and lighter for shapes and text
          - check Adobe color, choose one of :
            - Analogous
            - Monochromatic
            - Triad
            - Complementary (use primary and secondary color)
          

          ### Building a Color Scheme
          
          - First work on the website in just black and white
          - add one color
          - add an other color only if you have to
          - work with complimentary colors
          - add variation with shades
          - bring in a complimentary color
          
          
          - Start designing in black and white to focus on layout and structure.
          - Introduce one main color to establish the brand identity.
          - Add a secondary color only if necessary to support the primary color.
          - Use shades and tints to add depth and dimension.
          - Incorporate a complementary color to create visual interest and balance.
