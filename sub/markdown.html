Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax. Its main design goal is to be as readable as possible. <br> The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags <br> or formatting instructions. Here are some of the basic and most commonly used Markdown syntax elements:
  
  Headings: Created by adding # in front of a word or phrase. The number of # used determines the level of the heading. For example:
  # Heading level 1
  ## Heading level 2
  ### Heading level 3
  
  Paragraphs: Just typing text on a new line is considered a paragraph. For a line break, end a line with two or more spaces before hitting return.
  Emphasis:
  Italic: Wrap text with one asterisk or underscore.
  Bold: Wrap text with two asterisks or underscores.
  Strikethrough: Wrap text with two tildes.
  Lists:
Unordered lists use asterisks, pluses, or hyphens as list markers.
Ordered lists use numbers followed by periods.
Links: To create a link, wrap the link text in brackets [ ], and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses ( ).
Images: Similar to links, but an exclamation mark ! is added before the brackets.
Blockquotes: Use > before the text.
Code: To format text as code, use backticks. For inline code, use a single backtick before and after the text. For a code block, <br> use three backticks or indent every line of the block by four spaces.
Tables: Create tables by using hyphens - for creating headers and pipes | for columns.
Here’s a simple example of a Markdown-formatted text:

# Sample Document

## Introduction
This is a *sample* document to demonstrate **Markdown syntax**.

### Lists
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Sub Item 2.1
- Sub Item 2.2

### Code
`Inline code` with backticks.


Code block
print(“Hello, Markdown!”)


### Link
[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

### Image
!Alt text

Headings: Markdown uses # symbols to create headings, with different levels indicated by the number of # symbols.
Emphasis: Text can be italicized by wrapping it with * or _, and bolded with ** or __.
Strikethrough: Use ~~ before and after the text to apply a strikethrough effect.
Lists: Unordered lists are created using *, and ordered lists with numbers followed by a period.
Links: To add a hyperlink, use the format link text, and for images, !alt text.

---------------
Headings: You've demonstrated how to create headings from H1 (most important) to H6 (least important) using hash symbols (#).

HTML Integration: You've correctly pointed out that while Markdown is simpler, you can also use HTML tags within it for specific formatting needs.

Comments: You've included a comment section using HTML comments syntax ().

Text Formatting:

Italics: You've shown both asterisk (*) and underscore (_) for italicizing text.
Bold: Similarly, you've demonstrated bolding with double asterisks (**) and underscores (__).
Strikethrough: The wavy tilde symbol (~~) creates strikethrough text.
Horizontal Rule: You've included two ways to create horizontal lines using dashes (-) or underscores (_).

Blockquotes: The greater than symbol (>) creates blockquotes for indented quotations.

Links:

Internal Links: You've shown how to link to another heading within the document using its ID enclosed in square brackets.
External Links: You've demonstrated creating links to external websites with text descriptions (optional).
Lists:

Unordered Lists: Asterisks (*) or hyphens (-) create unordered lists. You've also included nested items.
Ordered Lists: Numbers (1.) automatically create ordered lists.
Code Blocks:

Inline Code: Backticks () enclose short inline code snippets.
Fenced Code Blocks: Code blocks with more lines are created using three backticks or tildes at the beginning and end, <br> optionally specifying a programming language for syntax highlighting.
Images: You've included the syntax for embedding images with an alt text description and a link to the image source.

Tables: You've created a simple table structure with headers and rows.

Task Lists: Asterisks (*) with checkboxes ([x] for completed, [ ] for pending) create task lists.
